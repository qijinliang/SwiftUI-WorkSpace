### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager][2] is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies on all platforms.

Adding `Parma` as a dependency by [using Xcode’s GUI][3], the package url is `https://github.com/dasautoooo/Parma` .

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `Parma` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Parma'
```


## Appearance Customization
To customize `Text` styles and `View`s, create a new render which conform to protocol `ParmaRenderable`, and only reimplement those that fit your purposes. Finally, assign the customized render as a new render when create `Parma` view.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Parma

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var markdown: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            Parma(markdown)
                .padding(.horizontal, 24)
        }
        .onAppear {
            let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "SampleMarkdown", withExtension: "md")!
            markdown = try! String(contentsOf: url)
        }
    }
}
```

## Name Origin
[Parma][5] is a city in the northern Italy, which is famous for its architecture, music and art. The reason of choosing this city name as the project name is [Giambattista Bodoni][6], a famous typographer, who spent most his lifetime living and working in this city.

Bodoni was an Italian typographer, type-designer in Parma. During his lifespan, he designed many typefaces that known as [Bodoni][7] nowadays. Each Mac has Bodoni font installed, and free to use.

The package is built upon [Down][8], which is a markdown parser in Swift.
